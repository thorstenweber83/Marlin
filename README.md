## Marlin 1.1

Marlin 1.1 represents an evolutionary leap over Marlin 1.0.2. It is the result of over two years of effort by several volunteers around the world who have paid meticulous and sometimes obsessive attention to every detail. For this release we focused on code quality, performance, stability, and overall user experience. Several new features have also been added, many of which require no extra hardware.

For complete Marlin documentation click over to the [Marlin Homepage <marlinfw.org>](http://marlinfw.org/), where you will find in-depth articles, how-to videos, and tutorials on every aspect of Marlin, as the site develops. For release notes, see the [Releases](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases) page.

## Stable Release Branch

This Release branch contains the latest tagged version of Marlin (currently 1.1.5 – August 2017).

Previous releases of Marlin include [1.0.2-2](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.2-2) (December 2016) and [1.0.1](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.1) (December 2014). Any version of Marlin prior to 1.0.1 (when we started tagging versions) can be collectively referred to as Marlin 1.0.0.

## Current Status: In Development

Marlin development has reached an important milestone with its first stable release in over 2 years. During this period we focused on cleaning up the code and making it more modern, consistent, readable, and sensible.

- This branch is for fixing bugs and integrating any new features for the duration of the Marlin 1.1.x life-cycle. We've opted for a simplified branch structure while we work on the maintainability and encapsulation of code modules. Version 2.0 and beyond should improve on separation of bug fixes and cutting-edge development.
- Follow the proper coding style to gain points with the maintainers. See our [Coding Standards](http://marlinfw.org/docs/development/coding_standards.html) page for more information.
- Please submit your questions and concerns to the [Issue Queue](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues). The "naive" question is often the one we forget to ask.


Marlin 1.1 is the last "flat" version of Marlin!

Arduino IDE now has support for folder hierarchies, so Marlin 1.2 will have a [hierarchical file structure](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/breakup-marlin-idea). Marlin's newly reorganized code will be easier to work with and form a stronger starting-point as we get into [32-bit CPU support](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/32-Bit-RCBugFix-new) and the Hardware Access Layer (HAL).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](https://github.com/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
